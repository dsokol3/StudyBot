# Test Document for ChatBot Application

## Introduction
This is a test document to verify the ChatBot application is working correctly with Google Gemini embeddings and Groq API for text generation.

## Key Concepts

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. The main types of machine learning are:
- Supervised learning: Learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement learning: Learning through trial and error

### Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Key NLP tasks include:
- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation

### Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings are dense representations of words, sentences, or documents in a continuous vector space. They capture semantic meaning and relationships between text elements. Common embedding models include:
- Word2Vec
- GloVe
- BERT
- GPT embeddings
- Google Gemini embeddings (text-embedding-004)

## Testing Requirements
1. Document upload should process this text file
2. Embeddings should be generated using Google Gemini API
3. Vector search should find relevant chunks
4. Groq API should generate responses based on the document content
5. Study tools (summaries, flashcards, quizzes) should work correctly

## Important Facts
- The Gemini embedding model produces 768-dimensional vectors
- The Groq API uses llama-3.1-8b-instant for fast inference
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension stores the embeddings
- The system supports various document formats: PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX

## Conclusion
This test document contains sufficient information to verify all features of the ChatBot application are working correctly.
